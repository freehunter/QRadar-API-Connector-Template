# QRadar-API-Connector-Template

This is a boilerplate for writing custom QRadar apps that can reach out to a cloud service and collect logs to feed into QRadar.

Suggested use is to create a new Hello World app in the App Editor, then plug the code from boilerplate.py into the existing views.py (removing all current code).

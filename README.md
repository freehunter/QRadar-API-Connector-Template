# QRadar-API-Connector-Template

This is a boilerplate for writing custom QRadar apps that can reach out to a cloud service and collect logs to feed into QRadar.

Suggested use is to create a new Hello World app in the App Editor, then plug the code from boilerplate.py into the existing views.py (removing all current code).

I've also included duo.py, which shows how you might extend this boilerplate to be used with a real actual log source (Duo Security).
